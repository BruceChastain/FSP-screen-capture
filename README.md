FSP-screen-capture
==================

Introduction:

The goal of FSP screen capture is to provide a simple and super fast screen capture without all the hassle of selecting the capture type, file name, file location, file type or anything like that. Once FSP screen capture is setup it's literally a one button operation. If you like this app feel free to send me an mbit or whatever here: 18uTaHgmAhyNuFJnFDi7zcxXTHYtqZeAof


Installation:

FSP screen capture is avaliable for Linux and Windows. For Linux you just get the single Python file. For Windows there is a complied .exe and supporting files.

  Linux:
  -Place the "FSP screen capture" where you want to run the application from. My suggestion is somewhere in the home directory so there will be no problems about write permissions when running the application.
  
  Windows:
  -Extract the “FSP-screen-capture-master” file to the location you want to run the application from for example in “my documents”.

  -To make FSP screen capture easier to use, right click on “FSP screen capture.exe” (inside the "FSP screen capture" folder) and select “send shortcut to desktop. Now you can launch it from the desktop. To make it even easier drag that shortcut from the desktop to the task bar. Now you can simply click the icon on the task bar to grab a screen shot.
  
  
Usage:

-To use FSP screen capture simply run the .exe for windows or the .py for linux (Windows of course can also run the .py but python will need to be installed)

-Within about one second the screen capture will be in a folder called “screencaps” inside the FSP screen capture. 

-FSP screen capture saves each screen capture with the file name matching the date and time, down to the second, that the screen capture was executed. For example: “2014_03_10_19_42_16”, YEAR_MONTH_DAY_HOUR_MINUTE_SECOND
