FSP-screen-capture
==================

Introduction:

The goal of FSP screen capture is to provide a simple and super fast screen capture without all the hassle of selecting the capture type, file name, file location, file type or anything like that. Once FSP screen capture is setup it's literally a one button operation.


Installation:

FSP screen capture is avaliable for Linux and Windows. For Linux you just get the single Python file. For Windows there is a complied .exe so that Windows users don't have to installed Python.

  Linux:
  -Extract the “FSP screen capture.gz” to the location which you want to run the application from. My suggestion is    
  somewhere in the home directory so there will be no problems about write permissions when running the application.
  -Install the somethingsomething library for python apt-get install somethingsomething
  
  Windows:
  -Extract the “FSP screen capture.zip” file to the location you want to run the application from for example in “my 
  documents”.
  -To the tool easier to use, right click on “FSP screen capture.exe” and select “send shortcut to desktop. Now you can 
  launch it from the desktop. To make it even easier drag that shortcut to the task bar. Now you can simple click the icon
  on the task bar to grab a screen shot.
  
  
Usage:

-To use FSP screen capture simple run the .exe for windows or the .py for linux (Windows of course can also runt he .py but python and the right libraries will need to be installed)

-After launching FSP screen capture a command or terminal box will briefly appear indicating that it's working, normally this only stays up for about a second. 

-Once the command or terminal box is gone your screen capture is ready. The screen capture will be in a folder called “screencaps” inside the main folder you extracted during installation. 

-FSP screen capture saves each screen capture with the file name matching the date and time, down to the second, that the screen capture was executed. For example: “2014_03_10_19_42_16”, YEAR_MONTH_DAY_HOUR_MINUTE_SECOND
